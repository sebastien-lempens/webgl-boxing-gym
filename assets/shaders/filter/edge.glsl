description: Wrapper around three different edge detection algorithms Sobel, Prewitt, and directional Sobel
use: edge(<sampler2D> texture, <vec2> st, <vec2> pixels_scale)
options:
    EDGE_FNC: Edge detection algorithm, defaults to edgeSobel, edgePrewitt & edgeSobel_directional also available
    EDGE_TYPE: Return type, defaults to float
    EDGE_SAMPLER_FNC: Function used to sample the input texture, defaults to texture2D(tex,POS_UV).r
